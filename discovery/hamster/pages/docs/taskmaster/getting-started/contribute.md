# Contributing to Taskmaster

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Taskmaster! We're excited to work with you and appreciate your help in making this project better.

## Our Collaborative Approach

We're a **PR-friendly team** that values collaboration:

* We review PRs quickly — Usually within hours, not days
* We're super reactive — Expect fast feedback and engagement
* We sometimes take over PRs — If your contribution is valuable but needs cleanup, we might jump in to help finish it
* We're open to all contributions — From bug fixes to major features

**We don't mind AI-generated code**, but we do expect you to:

* **Review and understand** what the AI generated
* **Test the code thoroughly** before submitting
* **Ensure it's well-written** and follows our patterns
* Don't submit "AI slop" — untested, unreviewed AI output

> **Why this matters**: We spend significant time reviewing PRs. Help us help you by submitting quality contributions that save everyone time!

## Quick Start for Contributors

### 1\. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-task-master.git
cd claude-task-master
npm install

```

### 2\. Create a Feature Branch

**Important**: Always target the `next` branch, not `main`:

```bash
git checkout next
git pull origin next
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

```

### 3\. Make Your Changes

Follow our development guidelines below.

### 4\. Test Everything Yourself

**Before submitting your PR**, ensure:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check formatting
npm run format-check

# Fix formatting if needed
npm run format

```

### 5\. Create a Changeset

**Required for most changes**:

```bash
npm run changeset

```

See the [Changeset Guidelines](#changeset-guidelines) below for details.

### 6\. Submit Your PR

* Target the `next` branch
* Write a clear description
* Reference any related issues

## Development Guidelines

### Branch Strategy

* **`main`**: Production-ready code
* **`next`**: Development branch — **target this for PRs**
* **Feature branches**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`

### Code Quality Standards

1. Write tests for new functionality
2. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. Add JSDoc comments for functions
4. Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Testing Requirements

Your PR **must pass all CI checks**:

* **Unit tests**: `npm test`
* **Format check**: `npm run format-check`

**Test your changes locally first** — this saves review time and shows you care about quality.

## Changeset Guidelines

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and generate changelogs.

### When to Create a Changeset

**Always create a changeset for**:

* New features
* Bug fixes
* Breaking changes
* Performance improvements
* User-facing documentation updates
* Dependency updates that affect functionality

**Skip changesets for**:

* Internal documentation only
* Test-only changes
* Code formatting/linting
* Development tooling that doesn't affect users

### How to Create a Changeset

1. After making your changes:  
```bash  
npm run changeset  
```
2. Choose the bump type:  
   * **Major**: Breaking changes  
   * **Minor**: New features  
   * **Patch**: Bug fixes, docs, performance improvements
3. Write a clear summary:  
```text  
Add support for custom AI models in MCP configuration  
```
4. Commit the changeset file with your changes:  
```bash  
git add .changeset/*.md  
git commit -m "feat: add custom AI model support"  
```

### Changeset vs Git Commit Messages

* **Changeset summary**: User-facing, goes in CHANGELOG.md
* **Git commit**: Developer-facing, explains the technical change

Example:

```bash
# Changeset summary (user-facing)
"Add support for custom Ollama models"

# Git commit message (developer-facing)
"feat(models): implement custom Ollama model validation

- Add model validation for custom Ollama endpoints
- Update configuration schema to support custom models
- Add tests for new validation logic"

```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* npm or yarn

### Environment Setup

1. Copy environment template:  
```bash  
cp .env.example .env  
```
2. Add your API keys (for testing AI features):  
```bash  
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here  
# Add others as needed  
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

```

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for consistent formatting:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format-check

# Fix formatting
npm run format

```

## PR Guidelines

### Before Submitting

* **Target the `next` branch**
* **Test everything locally**
* **Run the full test suite**
* **Check code formatting**
* **Create a changeset** (if needed)
* **Re-read your changes** — ensure they're clean and well-thought-out
